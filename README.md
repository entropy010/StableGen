## üåü Key Features

StableGen empowers 3D artists by bringing cutting-edge AI texturing capabilities into Blender:

* üåç **Scene-Wide Multi-Mesh Texturing:**
    * Don't just texture one mesh at a time! StableGen is designed to apply textures to **all visible mesh objects in your scene simultaneously** from your defined camera viewpoints.
    * Achieve a cohesive look across entire environments or collections of assets in a single generation pass.
    * Ideal for concept art, look development for complex scenes, and batch-texturing asset libraries.
* üé® **Multi-View Consistency:**
    * **Sequential Mode:** Generates textures viewpoint by viewpoint on each mesh, using inpainting and visibility masks for high consistency across complex surfaces.
    * **Grid Mode:** Processes multiple viewpoints for all meshes simultaneously for faster previews. Includes an optional refinement pass.
    * Sophisticated weighted blending ensures smooth transitions between views.
* üìê **Precise Geometric Control with ControlNet:**
    * Leverage multiple ControlNet units (Depth, Canny, Normal) simultaneously to ensure generated textures respect your model's geometry.
    * Fine-tune strength, start/end steps for each ControlNet unit.
    * Supports custom ControlNet model mapping.
* üñåÔ∏è **Powerful Style Guidance with IPAdapter:**
    * Use external reference images to guide the style, mood, and content of your textures with IPAdapter.
    * Employ IPAdapter without an reference image for enhanced consistency in multi-view generation modes.
    * Control IPAdapter strength, weight type, and active steps.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible ComfyUI Backend:**
    * Connects to your existing ComfyUI installation, allowing you to use your preferred SDXL checkpoints. Experimental support for FLUX.1-dev.
    * Offloads heavy computation to the ComfyUI server, keeping Blender mostly responsive.
* ‚ú® **Advanced Inpainting & Refinement:**
    * **Refine Mode (Img2Img):** Re-style, enhance, or add detail to existing textures (StableGen generated or otherwise) using an image-to-image process. Choose to preserve original textures for localized refinement.
    * **UV Inpaint Mode:** Intelligently fills untextured areas directly on your model's UV map using surrounding texture context.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Integrated Workflow Tools:**
    * **Camera Setup:** Quickly add and arrange multiple cameras around your subject.
    * **View-Specific Prompts:** Assign unique text prompts to individual camera viewpoints for targeted details.
    * **Texture Baking:** Convert complex procedural StableGen materials into standard UV image textures.
    * **HDRI Setup, Modifier Application, Curve Conversion & Orbit GIF/MP4 Export.**
* üìã **Preset System:**
    * Get started quickly with built-in presets for common scenarios (e.g., "Default", "Characters", "Quick Draft").

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (A Glimpse)

StableGen acts as an intuitive interface within Blender that communicates with a ComfyUI backend.
1.  You set up your scene and parameters in the StableGen panel.
2.  StableGen prepares necessary data (like ControlNet inputs from camera views).
3.  It constructs a workflow and sends it to your ComfyUI server.
4.  ComfyUI processes the request using your selected diffusion models.
5.  Generated images are sent back to Blender.
6.  StableGen applies these images as textures to your models using sophisticated projection and blending techniques.

---

## üíª System Requirements

* **Blender:** Version 4.0 or newer.
* **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 or Linux.
* **GPU:** **NVIDIA GPU with CUDA is recommended** for ComfyUI. For further details, check ComfyUI's github page: [https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).
* **ComfyUI:** A working installation of ComfyUI. StableGen uses this as its backend.
* **Python:** Version 3.x (usually comes with Blender, but Python 3 is needed for the `installer.py` script).
* **Git:** Required by the `installer.py` script.
* **Disk Space:** Significant free space for ComfyUI, AI models (10GB to 50GB+), and generated textures.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Setting up StableGen involves installing ComfyUI, then StableGen's dependencies into ComfyUI using our installer script, and finally installing the StableGen plugin in Blender.

### Step 1: Install ComfyUI (If not already installed)

StableGen relies on a working ComfyUI installation as its backend.
1.  If you don't have ComfyUI, please follow the **official ComfyUI installation guide**: [https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI#installing](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI#installing).
    * Install ComfyUI in a dedicated directory. We'll refer to this as `<YourComfyUIDirectory>`.
    * Ensure you can run ComfyUI and it's functioning correctly before proceeding.
    * Remote ComfyUI instances are not currently supported.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (Custom Nodes & AI Models) - Automated (Recommended)

The `installer.py` script (found in this repository) automates the download and placement of required ComfyUI custom nodes and core AI models into your `<YourComfyUIDirectory>`.

**Prerequisites for the installer:**
* Python 3.
* Git installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
* The path to your ComfyUI installation (`<YourComfyUIDirectory>`).
* Required Python packages for the script: `requests` and `tqdm`. Install them via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests tqdm
    ```

**Running the Installer:**
1.  **Download/Locate the Installer:** Get `installer.py` from this GitHub repository.
2.  **Execute the Script:**
    * Open your system's terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory containing `installer.py`.
    * Run the script:
        ```bash
        python installer.py <YourComfyUIDirectory>
        ```
        Replace `<YourComfyUIDirectory>` with the actual path. If omitted, the script will prompt for it.
3.  **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
    * The script will display a menu of installation packages (Minimal, Essential, Recommended, Complete SDXL). Choose one based on your needs.
    * It will download and place files into the correct subdirectories of `<YourComfyUIDirectory>`.
4.  **Restart ComfyUI:** If ComfyUI was running, restart it to load new custom nodes.

*(For manual dependency installation, see `docs/MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md`.)*

### Step 3: Install StableGen Blender Plugin

1.  Go to the [**Releases** page](https://github.com/sakalond/stablegen/releases) of this repository.
2.  Download the latest `StableGen.zip` file.
3.  In Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install...`.
4.  Navigate to and select the downloaded `StableGen.zip` file.
5.  Enable the "StableGen" addon (search for "StableGen" and check the box).
    * *Upon first installation, Blender may freeze for a minute as it will install necessary Python packages (e.g., `websockets`, `imageio`, `opencv-python`).*

### Step 4: Configure StableGen Plugin in Blender

1.  In Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
2.  Find "StableGen" and expand its preferences.
3.  Set the following paths:
    * **Model Directory:** Path to your SDXL checkpoint models (e.g., `<YourComfyUIDirectory>/models/checkpoints/`).
    * **Output Directory:** Choose a folder where StableGen will save generated images.
    * **Server Address:** Ensure this matches your ComfyUI server (default `http://127.0.0.1:8188`).
    * Review **ControlNet Mapping** if using custom named ControlNet models.

## üìñ Usage & Parameters Overview

StableGen provides a comprehensive interface for controlling your AI texturing process, from initial setup to final output. Here's an overview of the main sections and tools available in the StableGen panel:

### Primary Actions & Scene Setup

These are the main operational buttons and initial setup tools, generally found near the top of the StableGen panel:

* **Generate / Cancel Generation (Main Button):** This is the primary button to start the AI texture generation process for all visible meshes based on your current settings. It communicates with the ComfyUI backend. While processing, the button changes to "Cancel Generation," allowing you to stop the current task. Progress bars will appear below this button during generation.
* **Bake Textures:** Converts the dynamic, multi-projection material StableGen creates on your meshes into a single, standard UV-mapped image texture per object. This is essential for exporting or simplifying scenes. You can set the resolution and UV unwrapping method for the bake. This option is crucial for finalizing your AI-generated textures into a portable format.
* **Add Cameras:** Helps you quickly set up multiple viewpoints. It creates a circular array of Blender cameras around the active object (if "Object" center type is chosen) or the current 3D view center. You can specify the number of cameras and interactively adjust their positions before finalizing.
* **Collect Camera Prompts:** Cycles through all cameras in your scene, allowing you to type a specific descriptive text prompt for each viewpoint (e.g., "front view," "close-up on face"). These per-camera prompts are used in conjunction with the main prompt if "Use camera prompts" is enabled in "Viewpoint Blending Settings."

### Preset Management

* Located prominently in the UI, this system allows you to:
    * **Select a Preset:** Choose from built-in configurations (e.g., "Default," "Characters," "Quick Draft") for common scenarios or select "Custom" to use your current settings.
    * **Apply Preset:** If you modify a stock preset, this button applies its original values.
    * **Save Preset:** When your settings are "Custom," this allows you to save your current configuration as a new named preset.
    * **Delete Preset:** Removes a selected custom preset.

### Main Parameters

These are your primary controls for defining the generation:

* **Prompt:** The main text description of the texture you want to generate.
* **Model (SDXL):** Select the base SDXL checkpoint model.
* **Architecture:** Choose between `SDXL` and `Flux 1` (experimental) model architectures.
* **Generation Mode:** Defines the core strategy for texturing:
    * `Generate Separately`: Each viewpoint generates independently.
    * `Generate Sequentially`: Viewpoints generate one by one, using inpainting from previous views for consistency.
    * `Generate Using Grid`: Combines all views into a grid for a single generation pass, with an optional refinement step.
    * `Refine/Restyle Texture (Img2Img)`: Uses the current texture as input for an image-to-image process.
    * `UV Inpaint Missing Areas`: Fills untextured areas on a UV map via inpainting.

### Advanced Parameters (Collapsible Sections)

Click the arrow next to each title to expand and access detailed settings:

* **Core Generation Settings:** Control diffusion basics like Seed, Steps, CFG, Negative Prompt, Sampler, Scheduler, LoRA type (currently only supporting Lighting and Hyper LoRAs for faster generation times), and Clip Skip.
* **Viewpoint Blending Settings:** Manage how textures from different camera views are combined, including camera-specific prompts, discard angles, and blending weight exponents.
* **Output & Material Settings:** Define fallback color, material properties (BSDF), automatic resolution scaling, and options for baking textures during generation which enables generating with more than 8 viewpoints.
* **Image Guidance (IPAdapter & ControlNet):** Configure IPAdapter for style transfer using external images and set up multiple ControlNet units (Depth, Canny, etc.) for precise structural control.
* **Inpainting Options:** Fine-tune masking and blending for `Sequential` and `UV Inpaint` modes (e.g., differential diffusion, mask blurring/growing).
* **Generation Mode Specifics:** Parameters unique to the selected Generation Mode, like refinement options for Grid mode or IPAdapter consistency settings for Sequential/Separate/Refine modes.

### Integrated Workflow Tools (Bottom Section)

A collection of utilities to further support your texturing workflow:

* **Switch Material:** For selected objects with multiple material slots, this tool allows you to quickly set a material at a specific index as the active one.
* **Add HDRI Light:** Prompts for an HDRI image file and sets it up as the world lighting, providing realistic illumination for your scene.
* **Apply All Modifiers:** Iterates through all mesh objects in the scene, applies their modifier stacks, and converts geometry instances (like particle systems or collection instances) into real mesh data. This helps prepare models for texturing.
* **Convert Curves to Mesh:** Converts any selected curve objects into mesh objects, which is necessary before StableGen can texture them.
* **Export Orbit GIF/MP4:** Creates an animated GIF and MP4 video of the currently active object, with the camera orbiting around it. Useful for quickly showcasing your textured model. You can set duration, frame rate, and resolution.

Experiment with these settings and tools to achieve a vast range of effects and control! Remember that the optimal parameters can vary greatly depending on the model, subject matter, and desired artistic style.

## ü§î Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are some common fixes. Always check the **Blender System Console** (Window > Toggle System Console) AND the **ComfyUI server console** for error messages.

* **StableGen Panel Not Showing:** Ensure the addon is installed and enabled in Blender's preferences.
* **"Cannot generate..." on Generate Button:** Check Addon Preferences: "Model Directory," "Output Directory," and "Server Address" must be correctly set.
* **Connection Issues with ComfyUI:**
    * Make sure your ComfyUI server is running.
    * Verify the "Server Address" in StableGen preferences.
    * Check firewall settings.
* **Models Not Found (Error in ComfyUI Console):**
    * Run the `installer.py` script.
    * Manually ensure models are in the correct subfolders of `<YourComfyUIDirectory>/models/` (e.g., `checkpoints/`, `controlnet/`, `loras/`, `ipadapter/`, `clip_vision/`).
    * Restart ComfyUI after adding new models or custom nodes.
* **GPU Out Of Memory (OOM):**
    * Enable "Auto Rescale Resolution."
    * Try lower bake resolutions if baking.
    * Close other GPU-intensive applications.
* **Poor Texture Quality/Artifacts:**
    * Try using the provided presets.
    * Adjust prompts and negative prompts.
    * Experiment with different Generation Modes. `Sequential` with IPAdapter is often good for consistency.
    * Ensure adequate camera coverage and appropriate "Discard-Over Angle."
    * Fine-tune ControlNet strength. Too low might ignore geometry; too high might yield flat results.
    * For `Sequential` mode, check inpainting and visibility mask settings.
* **All Visible Meshes Textured:** StableGen textures all visible mesh objects. Hide objects (for rendering) you don't want processed.
